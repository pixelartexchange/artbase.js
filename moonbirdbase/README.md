## Open Questions - Request for Comments - What's Your Take?

**Metadata**

The metadata for the legendary moonbirds for body / feathers
looks broken, that is, shouldn't it be the other way
e.g.  body - Golden / Cosmic / Enlightened / Glitch / Jade
as feather
and the feathers e.g.
Legendary Crescent, Legendary Emperor,
Legendary Professor etc.

as bodies without the legendary "qualifier". See the idea to add
a legendary boolean true/false flag.

e.g.

- Golden / Legendary Crescent
- Cosmic / Legendary Professor
- Glitch / Legendary Emperor
- ...

change to

-  Crescent / Golden
-  Professor / Cosmic
-  Emperor / Glitch
- ...


What to do with the pairs:

- ruby skeleton / legendary bone
- skeleton / bone
- robot / metal

use ???

- skeleton / bone (ruby)  or ruby skeleton / bone ???
- skeleton / bone
- robot / metal



One idea is to add the missing eye color and beak color. Why? Why not?

One idea is to add a new legendary boolean true/false
attribute  to let you query for all legendary moonbirds (incl. skeleton and ruby skeleton and robot?)


Another idea ids to add a new type or species attribute
with values - owl, skeleton, robot, and ... ?

is glitch its own type? or cosmic? why? why not?




**images**

One idea is to make the moonbirds more reuseable
by using transparent backgrounds (by default) and, thus,
remove the (solid color) background  except for three 1/1 gradient backgrounds for legendaries cosmic, enlightened, & jade.  Why? why not?
